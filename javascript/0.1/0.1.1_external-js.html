<!-- The async and defer attributes on a script tag tell the browser how to load and execute the script.
The async attribute tells the browser to load and execute the script as soon as it is available, without blocking other resources from loading.
The defer attribute tells the browser to load the script, but to wait until the HTML document has been parsed and rendered before executing it. -->
